Solve times obtained with constant viscosity (since $\eta=1$ in this benchmark).
These times will probably change substantially when/if the viscosity of the 
blob is large compared to the mantle viscosity.
Note that solve times do not substantially change if the tolerance is brought from 1e-8 to 1e-5.

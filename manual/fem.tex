The discretisation of the Stokes equations by means of the Finite Element Method
is presented in Chapter 5 of fieldstone. Numerical quadrature is explained in 
Section 3.1 and two-dimensional basis functions in Section 3.4.
Note that the special case of cylindrical axisymmetry is discussed in Section 5.4.3.

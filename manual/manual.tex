\subsection{Notes to self}

What I have tried to cure the pb of the weird anomalies at the poles.

\begin{itemize}
\item turning elements into real trapezes. Made things worse
\item different mappings. not much difference
\item when using blob, reduced densities. no difference
\item nb of quad points, no real difference
\item nb of elements in tangential direction, some difference but no cure 
\item when using blob, drho/rho, no diff 
\item type of b.c. at point corner below poles, no real diff 
\item scaling of G matrix
\item different rotations/bc for free slip, no difference
\item using cmat matrix for dev strain rate, helped a little bit, no cure 
\end{itemize}



%----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{To do list}
\begin{itemize}
\item visc profiles
\item rho profiles
\item time stepping
\item gravity calculations. import from f96, re-benchmark
\item CBF? 
\item compute self gravity for reduced density case 
\item export exx1 and exx3 to outside function, clean their code too? 
\item remove call to math 
\item bottom free slip 
\item change y for z in stone
\item use PREM gravity value
\item aspect with GMG ?
\item compute moment of inertia
\item by default code now uses elemental rho and eta. it changes things wrt exp0 benchmark results!
\end{itemize}

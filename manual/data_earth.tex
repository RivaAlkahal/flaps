We assume that viscosity is purely a function of depth\footnote{This is borrowed
from stone 71}.. 

Five radial viscosity profiles are available:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first viscosity profile is a constant viscosity for all depths of $10^{22}$ Pa s.
This value is an estimated value of what is normally found in the literature. 

\item The second viscosity profile comes from Yoshida et al (2001) \cite{yohk01}. It uses three different regions: lithosphere (0 km to 150 km), upper mantle (150 km to 670 km) and lower mantle (670 km to 2900 km).

\item The third viscosity profile comes from Steinberger \& Holmes (2008) \cite{stho08}
which is comparable to \cite{stca06}, but of the latter no available data was available.
Data is read from the file \texttt{DATA/EARTH/eta\_stho08.ascii}.

\item The fourth and fifth profile come from Ciskova et al (2012) \cite{civs12}.
Data is read from the file \texttt{DATA/EARTH/eta\_civs.ascii}.
The paper showcases two main families of radial viscosity profiles in literature. Family A, which has a sharp
increase below the 660 km transition zone and remains constant for most of the lower mantle
and family B which is much smoother over the transition zone and increases with depth in the lower mantle.

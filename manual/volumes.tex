Here we simply compute 
\[
{\cal V} = \sum_e \int_{\Omega_e} 2\pi x dV
\]
where the sum runs over all elements of the domain.
We of course have 
\[
{\cal V}_{analytical} = \frac43 \pi (R_2^3-R_1^3)
\]
so that we can compute the relative errors as a function of resolution, mapping and quadrature:

\noindent Conclusions:
\begin{itemize}
\item unsurprisingly $Q_1$ mapping yields the worst results
\item mapping is the controling factor, much more than quadrature
\item for the isoparametric element (mapping $Q_2$) the number of quadrature points 
is not critical. Results are virtually identical for {\python nqperdim=2,3,4,5}
\item $Q_3$ about one order of magnitude more accurate than $Q_2$ 
\item $Q_4$ mapping 3-4 orders of magnitude more accurate than $Q_2$ mapping
\end{itemize}
